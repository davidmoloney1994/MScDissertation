The following includes work for my MSc through the department of Statistics, University of Oxford. The work is based on the paper 'The ecology in the hematopoietic stem cell niche determines the clinical outcome in chronic myeloid leukemia' found at http://www.pnas.org/content/111/10/3883.abstract.

The code is written in R and implements Rstan (MCMCstan.R). The stan code is also attached  (odemcmc.stan).

The mcmc algorithm is defined in stan. For more information on stan, see http://mc-stan.org/

The final dissertation, as submitted to the University of Oxford, is found in DavidMoloneyDissertation.pdf. This file includes a condensed version of the R and Stan code.
